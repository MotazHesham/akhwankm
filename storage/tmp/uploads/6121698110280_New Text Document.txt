 I'm student at computer science in my last semester ..  In addition to my study , I study Laravel framework with my self and good understanding for  APIS, OOP concepts , GitHub usage , MySQL, and take courses and workshops in  deferent fields to expand my awareness and improve my skills as graphic design (photoshop / illustrator)and testing (ISTQB fundamentals) and my passion is learn new technologies and try to solve new problems that i never seen .. And in the end, I hope that  i will be one of your team . 



Since I took a course in design, this not only made me able to use Photoshop and Illustrator, but also added to me experience in how to build a suitable and consistent design and use colors that fit the design
